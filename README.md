# Asteroids (LUA / LOVE2D)

A minimalist recreation of the classic Asteroids arcade game, built using LUA and the LOVE2D framework. The project focuses on core game development fundamentals such as state management, collision detection, and modular code architecture.

## Features
- Player-controlled spaceship with thrust, rotation, and shooting
- Randomly generated asteroids with wrap-around movement
- Laser-based shooting and asteroid destruction
- Finite state machine (menu, gameplay, pause, game over)
- Modular object-oriented code structure
- Smooth gameplay at a stable frame rate

## Tech Stack
- LUA
- LOVE2D (v11.x)
- Modular, state-based game architecture
